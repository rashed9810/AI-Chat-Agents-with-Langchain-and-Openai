** Semantic Search Chatbot with Langchain and OpenAI

**Description:**

This project demonstrates a question-answering chatbot powered by semantic search with Langchain and OpenAI. It utilizes OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model to generate embeddings for both user queries and factual data stored in a Pinecone vector database. The Langchain library facilitates the retrieval and integration of relevant information to answer user questions in a comprehensive and informative way.

**Features:**

* **Semantic Search:** Leverages semantic similarity to retrieve the most relevant information from the knowledge base.
* **OpenAI Embeddings:** Generates high-quality vector representations of text for efficient retrieval.
* **Langchain Integration:** Provides a modular framework for building and managing chatbot functionalities.
* **Conversational Memory:** Maintains context across conversation turns for a more natural interaction.

**Installation:**

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended).
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install langchain openai datasets pinecone tqdm
   ```
3. Replace `""` with your OpenAI API key in `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `API_KEY` with your Pinecone API key and environment in `pinecone.init`.

**Data Preparation:**

1. The code utilizes the SQuAD dataset for demonstration purposes. You can replace it with your own question-answer data in a pandas dataframe format with columns for `context`, `question`, and `answers`.
2. Preprocess the data by removing duplicates and performing any necessary cleaning steps.

**Usage:**

1. Run the script `python chatbot.py`.
2. Interact with the chatbot by entering your questions.
3. The chatbot will retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base and provide informative answers.

**Further Exploration:**

* Experiment with different OpenAI embedding models to see how they impact performance.
* Integrate additional Langchain tools to expand the chatbot's capabilities (e.g., summarization, sentiment analysis).
* Train your own language model for a more personalized and engaging chatbot experience.

**Additional Notes:**

* This is a basic implementation and can be further customized for specific use cases.
* Be mindful of OpenAI's rate limits and pricing structure when using their services.
